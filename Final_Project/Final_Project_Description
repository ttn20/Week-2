Bank Marketing (Campaign)

Problem Statement:

ABC Bank wants to sell it's term deposit product to customers and before launching the product they want to develop a model which help them in understanding whether a particular customer will buy their product or not (based on customer's past interaction with bank or other Financial Institution).

 

Why ML Model: Bank wants to use ML model to shortlist customer whose chances of buying the product is more so that their marketing channel (tele marketing, SMS/email marketing etc)  can focus only to those customers whose chances of buying the product is more.
This will save resource and their time ( which is directly involved in the cost ( resource billing)).
Develop model with Duration and without duration feature and report the performance of the model.
Duration feature is not recommended as this will be difficult to explain the result to business and also it will
be difficult for business to campaign based on duration.

Imbalance data set: If dataset is imbalance then try to use techniques to handle imbalance data set and report model performance of each imbalance technique used (avoid techniques which recommend not to utilize whole available data)

Task:
Business Understanding
Data understanding
Exploratory data Analysis
Data Preparation
Model Building ( Logistic Regression, ensemble, Boosting etc)
Model Selection
Performance reporting
Deploy the model
Converting ML metrics into Business metric and explaining result to business
Prepare presentation for non technical persons.
 

Data Set Information :
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

 

Attribute Information:

Input variables:
# bank client data:
1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
# other attributes:
12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
# social and economic context attributes
16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

Output variable (desired target):
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
